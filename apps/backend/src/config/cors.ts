/**
 * Which browser origins may call this API.
 *
 * Production uses an explicit allowlist and nothing else — this API serves the
 * evidence behind saleable credits, so a permissive rule there would let any
 * page a signed-in operator visits drive it with their cookies.
 *
 * Development is deliberately looser, for a concrete reason: the capture PWA is
 * a *field* app, and the only honest way to test it is on a real phone, which
 * reaches this machine over the LAN on a DHCP address that changes. A fixed
 * allowlist makes that a config edit every time, and the failure it produces —
 * an opaque "Failed to fetch" with no server-side log — costs far more time than
 * it saves. So in development we accept loopback and private-network origins on
 * any port, and nothing else: still not a wildcard, and never public addresses.
