 * Create (or reset) an administrator account.

 * This is the answer to "the database is migrated and empty — how does anyone
 * sign in?". The development seed cannot be that answer: it refuses to run with
 * NODE_ENV=production, and it creates three accounts with published passwords.
 *
 * Unlike the seed, this touches exactly one table and creates exactly the
 * account you name, so it is safe to run against a live deployment:
 *
 *   ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com ADMIN_PASSWORD='...' npm run admin:create
 *
 * On a host with a one-off shell (Render, Railway, Fly) run it there so the
 * password never travels through a local shell history or a CI log.
