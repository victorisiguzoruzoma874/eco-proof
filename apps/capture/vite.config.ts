 * HTTPS is opt-in via `HTTPS=1`.

 * HTTPS, or localhost. Testing this app the way it is actually used — on a
 * phone, over the office wifi, at `http://192.168.x.x:3002` — is therefore an
 * insecure origin, where the camera is refused and the service worker never
 * registers, taking the offline queue with it.
 *
 * Turning it on serves a self-signed certificate, so the phone shows a warning
 * once. That is the trade for a real secure context on a real device.
 *
 * It stays off by default because plain http://localhost is already secure, and
 * the headless test suite talks to it over http.

/**
 * Same-origin path to the backend, so a phone never mixes schemes.
 *
 * Serving the app over HTTPS creates a second problem behind the first: a secure
 * page may not `fetch()` a plain-http endpoint, so pointing the app's Backend URL
 * at `http://192.168.x.x:3000` — the obvious move, and what the runbook used to
 * say — is blocked as mixed content. The camera works and every request fails.
 *
 * Proxying here means the phone talks to exactly one origin, over TLS, and Vite
 * forwards to the backend server-side where scheme mixing is nobody's business.
 * Set the app's Backend URL to `https://<this-host>:<port>/api`.
 *
 * Development only: `vite dev`/`preview` serve this, production does not.
