/**
 * Integrity outcomes, in words a collector can act on — both the server's
 * findings and the one check a device can run before it signs.
 *
 * A failed check is not a diagnostic here — it is unpaid work. The collector is
 * standing at a scale with the sack still in front of them, and the only thing
 * that matters is whether they can fix this weigh-in and whether they should
 * re-do it now or fetch an operator. `weight_in_range: 300 kg above hub maximum
 * 200 kg` answers neither: it names an internal check and leaves the person
 * holding the material to infer the rest.
 *
 * The raw finding is not lost by translating it. It stays on the event's
 * integrity verdict in the database, and the dashboard renders check names
 * verbatim, because an operator triaging quarantined events genuinely does want
 * the identifier. Two audiences, two renderings, one source finding.
 *
 * Copy rules, from the field:
 *
 * - Say what happened, then what to do. A sentence a collector cannot act on is
 *   noise on a small screen in daylight.
 * - Never blame the collector for something only an operator can fix. Enrolment
 *   and revocation are back-office states; the useful instruction is "ask an
 *   operator", not an apology.
 * - No jargon: no "signature", no "nonce", no "payload". "This phone" and "this
 *   weigh-in" are the only two objects a collector needs.
