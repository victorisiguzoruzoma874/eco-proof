/**
 * The material catalogue.
 *
 * A material code is part of the signed weigh-in payload, so it is hashed into
 * the Merkle leaf. That has a consequence which shapes everything in this
 * file: **a code that has been signed can never be renamed or deleted.** An
 * audit report replays the exact string the device signed, and a buyer
 * recomputing the root from the event list must get the same digest years
 * later. Rewriting "PS" to "POLYSTYRENE" in the database would not migrate
 * history — it would silently invalidate every batch that contained it.
 *
 * So the catalogue separates three things that are easy to conflate:
 *
 * - **code** — the signed identifier. Append-only, immutable, `PET`-shaped.
 * - **name** — what a human reads. Presentation only, freely editable, never
 *   signed and never hashed.
 * - **active** — whether the code may be chosen for *new* capture. Retiring a
 *   material hides it from the pickers; it does not touch a single stored event.
 *
 * "Removing a material" therefore means retiring it. The one exception is a code
 * that has never been used by any event or batch — a typo added minutes ago —
 * which the backend does allow to be deleted outright, because deleting it
 * cannot invalidate anything.
 */

/**
 * Shape of a code. Deliberately narrow: uppercase alphanumerics with internal
 * separators, 2–16 characters. Codes travel through a canonical JSON
 * serialisation and must be stable under transport and free of anything
 * needing escaping. The narrowness is also a guard against an operator typing
 * a display name into the code field and permanently minting `Clear bottle
 * plastic` as a signed identifier.
