 * This was a closed union of six literals until the catalogue moved into the

 * union compiled last week has no way to name it. Validation therefore moved
 * from the type system to two runtime layers — `MATERIAL_CODE_PATTERN` for
 * shape, and a catalogue lookup for existence — which is where it has to live
 * once the set is data rather than code.
 *
 * The wire format did not change. A code was serialised as a JSON string before
 * and is serialised as a JSON string now, so every root anchored under the old
 * union still recomputes identically. See `./materials.js` for why codes are
 * append-only.
